Format of the corpus:

==============================================

This corpus files contain two files: 'tweet-norm-XXX_annotated.txt' and 'tweet-norm-XXXX_ids.tsv'.

--> tweet-norm-XXXX_annotated.txt: this file contains a set of annotated tweets. The format of the file is the following:

tweetId1<tab>tweet1 Text
<tab>OOV1<blank_space>category_OOV1<blank_space>correct_formOOV1 **
<tab>OOV2<blank_space>category_OOV2<blank_space>correct_formOOV2
        ...
<tab>OOVn<blank_space>category_OOVn<blank_space>correct_formOOVn
tweetId2<tab>tweet2 Text
	...

   Where,
        category_OOV can be: 0=Variant , 1=Correct , or 2=NoEs
   and
        correct_formOOV is the corrected form of the OOV word in the case of Variants (0) or "-" in the case of Correct (1) and NoEs (2) categories. In cases where more than one corrected forms exist, forms are separated by the '_|_' sequence. e.g. 
"	Tranqui 0 Tranquila_|_Tranquilo" 


   ** Initial space is '\t', the rest are ' '. No other '\s' chars are used; if needed word forms contain the '_' character instead.

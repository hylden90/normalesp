Before using the main program (i.e., "/normalesp/spell_checking.py"), make sure the required services are running up. To do that, change directory to "/normalesp/", open a new terminal, and type the following instructions:

1. "python" (to start a Python instance).
2. "from spell_checking import _switch_normalisation_services".
3. "_switch_normalisation_services('on')".

It is strongly recommended NOT to close this terminal or type other Python instructions.

To stop the required services, please type "_switch_normalisation_services('off')".
